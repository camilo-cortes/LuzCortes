  	<p>Engaging students in their learning is a fundamental part of teaching. Therefore, the classroom environment and the strategies used should help and encourage learners to make connections. My classroom will provide students an inviting, and inclusive atmosphere where they will be encouraged to become the best of themselves. Respect, fairness, and consistency will establish routines, procedures, and behavior expectations. Learners will receive clear expectations, clear instructions in desirable classroom behavior, and I will reteach any lesson if it is necessary. Clear expectations and rules will make each student accountable for their learning.
The needs of each student in the class will be met consistently and fairly. All learners will have the opportunity of reaching their potential, as I will be aware of the diverse learning styles and individual needs. I will deliver the content in a way that it will inspire, energize, intrigue, and capture students’attention, which is fundamental to create the classroom community. By establishing sincere, warm, and friendly but yeah respectful relationships with students, it is possible to meet their needs, and also it contributes to creating rules and procedures.
Rules, procedures, and appropriate teaching strategies contribute to engaging students in an active and meaningful manner in their learning process. Making connections will help me to relate to students’ cultural backgrounds and interests and help develop students’ higher-level thinking skills (Jones & Jones 2013, p.169). An appropriate classroom atmosphere underwrites students success, as “engagement is possibly the gatekeeper to mental readiness” (Marzano 2017, p. 65). Respect, fairness, and consistency on each procedure, behavior expectations, and routines we do in class are essential to make those crucial connections, and they are a crucial part of providing an inclusive and safe classroom.</p>
