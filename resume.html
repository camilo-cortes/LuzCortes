    <p>Teaching is an art that requires skills, curiosity, creativity, innovation, and inspiration. Which allows teachers and learners to engage in thoughtful ways with their communities and society. Personal growth, teamwork, professionalism, and ethics are the fundament of commitment as a teacher. Therefore, students will receive an inclusive e inviting classroom environment, where respect and justice will motivate them to be better persons. 
During my program of study, I have learned that teamwork and open communication is vital for development as a professional. Collaborative efforts benefit the learners, and they are the reason for the teaching profession. I have learned to ask questions, receive and provide feedback, which was one of my most significant weakness at the beginning of the program. English is not my first language; before, I allowed the language barrier to interferer on my professional relationships. Little by little, asking for help became more comfortable. The multiple clinical field experiences challenged me to look for and make connections. Then, I realized our differences is what make uniqueness.
However, I should continue growing professionally by making connections, partnerships, and self-reflecting. Also, schooling transmits culture that helps students to make connections to better themselves and others. As an adult ELL student, I continue working on my writing and pronunciation every day. I am also aware that cultural background could affect students’ perceptions and my teaching philosophy. However, self-reflecting is another skill I have learned during the program, which will allow me to become a better person and be a role model for my students. Society is continuously changing, so, schooling should reflect those changes and motivate learners to become scholars for life (Webb, Metha, Jordan 2013, p.4-5).</p>

    <p><h2>Goal: Lesson planning
2019-2023… </h2>
 
I have faced many challenges during my student teaching experience, and lesson planning is one of them. Practical lesson plans are the most significant part of teaching, as students’ learning depends on it. A well-prepared lesson provides students opportunities to grow and learn more. However, when preparing a lesson, it is essential to have a “plan B”; it is part of being an effective teacher I want to be. Students tend to be more engaged when teachers deliver structured lessons and know how to connect students.
During and by the end of the student teaching experience, I should be able to prepare my lesson more effectively. I am getting in there! And it definitely will continue improving by 01/01/2020-2022. 
Steps:
Asking more questions: every day since I realized my challenges.
Taking better notes: 11/01/2019-08/20/2022
Organization: 11/01/2019
Planning book: 12/31/2021
Reviewing articles and putting together my notes from my classes and preview teaching experiences before entering a classroom as a lead teacher between 08/20/2020 to 08/20/2022.

<h2>Goal #2: Making connections
2019-2022… </h2>
 
I decided to make connections as one of my goals because of the benefits it will have for my students. On the one hand, senior teachers may know the students and can provide me a little bit of their background. Knowing my students since the beginning will help me to prepare the lessons and introduce myself. On the other hand, an experienced teacher could have helpful resources that I could use in my classroom. Also, the connections between professionals will provide students with a stable and consistent school environment, as we all will be on the same page. Teamwork is the primary key to achieve this goal. As a newer teacher, I should be able to share ideas and have an open mind to receive and provide feedback.
I do think that making connections should not have an ending date. However, the relationships I am building right now as a teaching student are only the beginning. Teamwork is essential, and I will be continually looking for ways to make professional connections.   01/01/2020-2022
Steps:
I will join teachers' networks as soon as I finish the student teaching experience, and I could become a member of them by 01/20/2020.
Also, I can reach this goal by meeting and asking experienced teachers about their experiences, and the best network to join it will continuously be my focus. By 08/20/2021 I should be able to become a member of some more systems and by 08/20/21-22 I will be part of the world language teacher association OFLA and NCSSFL, which are excellent sources of information.

<h2>Goal #3: Develop a clear grading philosophy
2019-2022 </h2>
During my student teaching practice, I have had a hard time grading and reporting assessment. Sometimes, I lost the objectivity of the evaluation and beginning to give or take points losing the purpose of it. Although experiences and knowing the students’ background will help, I should have a clear picture in mind to practice fairness when grading my students. Grades impact students’ motivation and learning. Also, grades could negatively impact students,  so I should be careful when evaluating or providing feedback in general. I have been working on this goal, and I want to have a clear picture before having a classroom on my own by 01/01/2021. However, the first two school year it will a process understanding so by 01/01/2022 it will be better developed.   
Steps:
I talk a lot with my mentor teacher about accomplishing this goal. I ask her critical questions on how she does it. I am also planning to attend professional development opportunities that are specific to the goals I am trying to reach: 01/10/2020
Learn about the diverse possible district I want to work within Ohio 01/15/2020-22
Research best practices and reasonings about grading students 01/20/20. During my career as a graduate student, I have plenty of notes, articles, and books that could help me to define and fair and reasonable grading philosophy. My teaching philosophy is based on three values: respect, fairness, and inclusion. The same goes when learning to grade my students, it is a process 01/20/22.
